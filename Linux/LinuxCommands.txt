print "aaaaa" | nawk -v lpar=$(hostname) -v tdate="`date`" -f testawk4.awk

Find command:
============
    for i in $(find Your_Mail_Dir/ -newermt "2011-01-01" ! -newermt "2011-12-31"); do
      mv $i /moved_emails_dir/
    done
    find /mnt -type f -name "*.jpg" -newermt "2014-12-14 01:00:00" ! -newermt "2014-12-14 02:00:00" -exec cp -pf {} /home/pi/box/pictures/ \; 
    find ~/tmp/ -type f  | awk -F/ '{ print $NF }'
    find ./dir1 -type f -exec basename {} \;
    find /dir1 -type f -printf "%f\n"
    
    -type f" option to tell find to locate only normal files, and ignore directories, links, and other filesystem objects.
        find /my/directory -name '*.jpg' -mtime -15s -mtime +2s
        find /home -iname ".c" -mtime -2 -mtime +4
     Start Date and End Date: find /path -newermt "2018-09-27" ! -newermt "2018-09-28"

echo "/home/subbukandula/data/abc def.txt" | awk -F'[/]' '{print $(NF)}'
$ echo "abc_asdfjhdsf_dfksfj_12345678.csv" | awk -F'[_.]' '{print $4}'
12345678
It sets the Field seperator as _ or .. Then printing the column number 4 will give you the desired result (you may also prefer $(NF-1) (the but-last field) instead of $4).

Change to the directory in which you want to install. Type:
cd directory_path_name
For example, to install the software in the /usr/java/ directory, Type:
cd /usr/java/

#!/bin/bash
for i in $(find Your_Mail_Dir/ -newermt "2011-01-01" ! -newermt "2011-12-31"); do
  mv $i /moved_emails_dir/
done
find . -mtime -90 -exec cp {} targetdir \;  (3 months copy)

for i in `ls -lrt | grep "jul" | awk '{print $9}' `; do cp $i* /some/folder/; done
cp  `find . -type f -newermt '18 sep 2016 20:05:00'` FOLDER
