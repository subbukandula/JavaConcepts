if you have a multi-project build You need a root project that contains settings.gradle file with something like:

include 'myproject1'
include 'myproject2'
Than you can just make a dependency from one project to another like this:

myproject1/gradle.build

task someOtherTask() << {
   println 'Hello'
}
myproject2/gradle.build

task sometask(dependsOn: ':myproject1:someOtherTask') << {
  //do something here
}
Or if you want to call a task:

project(':myproject1').tasks.build.execute()
Notice: You have to apply java plugin to make build task available.
