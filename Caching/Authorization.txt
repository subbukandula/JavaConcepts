The Basic and Digest authentication schemes are dedicated to the authentication using a username and a secret (see RFC7616 and RFC7617).

The Bearer authentication scheme is dedicated to the authentication using a token and is described by the RFC6750. Even if this scheme comes from an OAuth2 specification, you can still use it in any other context where tokens are exchange between a client and a server.
